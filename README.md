For use with MiSTer FPGA

Add the following to the end of your mister.ini:

[menu]
vga_scaler=1

fb_terminal=1

video_mode=320,8,32,24,240,4,3,16,6048

You may consider other video_mode perameters to draw the OSD to your monitor in an aspect ratio that pleases you. Unzip the wallpapers into a folder on SD root called "wallpapers". Boot the MiSTer and press F11 to cycle through the different wallpaper modes until you see one of the monitor images provided. Now any time you boot the MiSTer it will show one of the images.

For added nerd, create copies of each file and leave them in the same folder to adjust "rarity" of each "item", say, 4-8 copies of the Ring box, and only maybe 1 each of the extra lives, and 4 each for the shields.
